### RecyclerViewPreferences [![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/MFlisar/Settings.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#MFlisar/Settings)

A full recycler view based and NO XML preferences replacement with a lot of extra features. With the target that it supports settings and per item settings.

### Features

	* Boolean
	* Int
	* String
	* Enums/Lists (single + multi selection)
	* Info
	* Group (Title)
* Easily extendable (check e.g. the color module)
* view based, can be placed in any layout
* offers a custom view (`SettingsView`) that can be placed in your layout and does ALL the magic (restoring state, handling events and so on) for you with a single line of code (check `Demo1Activity`)
* saves and restores it's state automatically
* supports filtering
* supports nested settings
* supports different predefined style (ViewPager, List + w/o search bar) => you can define the layout yourself as well (check `Demo2Activity`)
* supports any storage, implementations for `SharedPreferences` as well as for `DataStore<Preferences>` are already available
